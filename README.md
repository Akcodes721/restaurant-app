## Ideas For Future Development

- Integration of payment systems. (Customers shouldn't reserve restaurant tables for free)
- Make the system more large-scale. For example, make it handle multiple restaurants.
- Implement mailing service which notifies customers for details about their reservation.
- Development of unit, integration and end-to-end tests.
- Restaurant should have schedule. On some days of the week the restaurant could be closed or opened earlier or later. Or on the other hand it won't work at all. In such cases there should be validations which prevent from making reservations.
